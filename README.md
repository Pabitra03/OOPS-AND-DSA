## Introduction 

Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) in Java helps you organize code using objects and classes, making it easier to reuse and maintain. Data Structures and Algorithms (DSA) involve organizing and processing data efficiently, using structures like arrays and linked lists, and techniques like sorting and searching. Learning OOP and DSA in Java is crucial for building strong, reliable software.
