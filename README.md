## Introduction 

Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) in Java helps you organize code using objects and classes, making it easier to reuse and maintain. Data Structures and Algorithms (DSA) involve organizing and processing data efficiently, using structures like arrays and linked lists, and techniques like sorting and searching. Learning OOP and DSA in Java is crucial for building strong, reliable software.

## OOP Concepts

In this directory, you'll find examples for the following concepts:

- **Classes and Objects**: Basics of classes, objects, and methods.
- **Inheritance**: Understanding single, multiple, and multilevel inheritance.
- **Polymorphism**: Implementation of method overloading and overriding.
- **Abstraction**: Working with abstract classes and interfaces.
- **Encapsulation**: Practice of data hiding using private fields and public methods.
- **Exception Handling**: Handling exceptions using try-catch blocks and custom exceptions.

## DSA Topics

In this directory, you'll find examples related to the following topics:

- **Arrays**: Basic operations, sorting, and searching algorithms.
- **Linked Lists**: Implementation of singly and doubly linked lists.
- **Stacks and Queues**: Implementation using arrays and linked lists.
- **Trees**: Binary trees, binary search trees, and tree traversal algorithms.
- **Graphs**: Representation of graphs and traversal algorithms like BFS and DFS.
- **Sorting Algorithms**: Bubble sort, selection sort, merge sort, quick sort, etc.
- **Searching Algorithms**: Linear search, binary search, etc.
- **Dynamic Programming**: Problems like Fibonacci sequence, knapsack problem, etc.
- **Recursion**: Basic and advanced recursion problems.
